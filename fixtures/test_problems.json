However, conventional metallic metasurfaces mainly efficiently work in the visible and near-infrared regime, and lack sufficient tunability. In this work, combining the pronounced plasmonic resonance of patterned graphene structures with a subwavelength-thick optical cavity, we propose and demonstrate novel graphene metasurfaces that manifest the potential to dynamically control the phase and amplitude of infrared light with very high efficiency. It is shown that the phase of the infrared light reflected from a simple graphene ribbon metasurface can span over almost the entire 2 range by changing the width of the graphene ribbons, while the amplitude of the reflection can be maintained at high values without significant variations. We successfully realize anomalous reflection, reflective focusing lenses, and non-diffracting Airy beams based on graphene metasurfaces. Our results open up a new paradigm of highly integrated photonic platforms for dynamic beam shaping and adaptive optics in the crucial infrared wavelength range.", "desc": "dynamically control the phase and amplitude of infrared light with very high efficiency", "user": null, "trial": null, "type": "make", "submit_date": null}}, {"model": "wordclouds.problem", "pk": 2, "fields": {"turk_id": "0c3xFNeP5P", "paper_id": null, "abstract": "The valuation of the real option to store liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the downstream terminal of an LNG value chain is an important problem in practice. As the exact valuation of this real option is computationally intractable, we develop a novel and tractable heuristic model for its strategic valuation that integrates models of LNG shipping, natural gas price evolution, and inventory control and sale into the wholesale natural gas market. We incorporate real and estimated data to quantify the value of this real option and its dependence on the throughput of an LNG chain, the type of price variability, the type of inventory control policy employed, and the level of stochastic variability in both the shipping model and the natural gas price model used. In addition, we develop an imperfect information dual upper bound to assess the effectiveness of our heuristic, and find that our method is highly accurate. Our approach also has potential relevance to value the real option to store other commodities in facilities located downstream from a commodity production or transportation stage, such as petroleum and agricultural products, chemicals, and metals, or the real option to store the input used in the production of a commodity, such as electricity.", "desc": "valuation of liquefied natural gas storage options", "user": null, "trial": null, "type": "make", "submit_date": null}}, {"model": "wordclouds.problem", "pk": 3, "fields": {"turk_id": "1ewbCznf4F", "paper_id": null, "abstract": "History event related knowledge is precious and imagery is a powerful medium that records diverse information about the event. In this paper, we propose to automatically construct an image profile given a one sentence description of the historic event which contains where, when, who and what elements. Such a simple input requirement makes our solution easy to scale up and support a wide range of culture preservation and curation related applications ranging from wikipedia enrichment to history education. However, history relevant information on the web is available as \"wild and dirty\" data, which is quite different from clean, manually curated and structured information sources. There are two major challenges to build our proposed image profiles: 1) unconstrained image genre diversity. We categorize images into genres of documents/maps, paintings or photos. Image genre classification involves a full-spectrum of features from low-level color to high-level semantic concepts. 2) image content diversity. It can include faces, objects and scenes. Furthermore, even within the same event, the views and subjects of images are diverse and correspond to different facets of the event. To solve this challenge, we group images at two levels of granularity: iconic image grouping and facet image grouping. These require different types of features and analysis from near exact matching to soft semantic similarity. We develop a full-range feature analysis module which is composed of several levels, each suitable for different types of image analysis tasks. The wide range of features are based on both classical hand-crafted features and different layers of a convolutional neural network. We compare and study the performance of the different levels in the full-range features and show their effectiveness on handling such a wild, unconstrained dataset.", "desc": "automatically construct an image profile given a one sentence description of the historic event which contains where, when, who and what elements", "user": null, "trial": null, "type": "make", "submit_date": null}}, {"model": "wordclouds.problem", "pk": 4, "fields": {"turk_id": "1p63yA50ad", "paper_id": null, "abstract": "We describe a method to extract tabular data from web pages.

Terminal displays in airports show arrival and departure information, monitors in hotels and convention centers show room assignments, and whiteboards in hospitals show schedules and help staff know what others are doing. One of the most important types of displays is the schedule board for surgical suites. Surgical suites are a highly dynamic setting, where doctors, nurses, equipment, rooms, and patients must be perfectly coordinated. Schedule changes occur frequently and must be shared among staff. This research examines the design of hospital architecture (placement of walls, corridors, furnishings) and information artifacts for more effective information sharing and coordination of surgeries. I conducted field studies in four hospital surgical suites and a survey of surgical suite directors nationwide. I describe factors of the architecture, and information available around surgical suite schedule displays that are associated with information sharing and coordination outcomes. From the field studies, I developed the concept of an information hotspot  a place where people congregate to receive and provide information, public displays offer up-to-date information, and coordination workers answer questions, resolve conflicts, and keep information up-to-date. The information hotspot concept guided my design research. I developed design principles for the placement of schedule boards and control desks; design guidelines for the location of surgical suite displays and control desks; an evaluation list for surgical suites; and a three-tiered design intervention strategy ranging in implementation effort. In a follow-up national survey of surgical suite directors, I studied linkages between surgical suite architecture, information artifacts and communication practices, workplace characteristics, information sharing, and coordination speed and stress. I found that visibility between the schedule board and control desk in the surgical suite, traffic-free areas around the schedule board, and complete, up-to-date schedule board information were related to information sharing and coordination outcomes.", "desc": "Effective information sharing and coordination of surgeries.", "user": null, "trial": null, "type": "understand + make", "submit_date": null}}, {"model": "wordclouds.problem", "pk": 6, "fields": {"turk_id": "29anwl7KZ1", "paper_id": null, "abstract": "Successful object recognition is essential for finding food, identifying kin, and avoiding danger, as well as many other adaptive behaviors. To accomplish this feat, the visual system must reconstruct 3-D interpretations from 2-D snapshots falling on the retina. Theories of recognition address this process by focusing on the question of how object representations are encoded with respect to viewpoint. Although empirical evidence has been equivocal on this question, a growing body of surprising results, including those obtained in the experiments presented in this case study, indicates that recognition is often viewpoint dependent. Such findings reveal a prominent role for viewpointdependent mechanisms and provide support for the multiple-views approach, in which objects are encoded as a set of view-specific representations that are matched to percepts using normalization procedures.", "desc": "Reconstruct 3-D interpretations from 2-D snapshots falling on the retina.", "user": null, "trial": null, "type": "understand", "submit_date": null}}, {"model": "wordclouds.problem", "pk": 7, "fields": {"turk_id": "44SWnb2Pwl", "paper_id": null, "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for fabricating soft and stretchable liquid-phase microelectronics that feature circuit elements with micron-scale line width. In contrast to conventional microelectronics, these circuits are composed of a soft elastomer embedded with microfl uidic channels fi lled with eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) metal alloy. The EGaIn traces are liquid at room temperature and therefore remain intact and electrically functional as the surrounding elastomer elastically deforms during stretching and bending. The fabrication method uses emerging techniques in soft lithography. Microchannels are molded on to the surface of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer and fi lled with EGaIn using a micro-transfer deposition step that exploits the unique wetting properties of EGaIn in air. After sealing with an addition layer of PDMS, the liquid-fi lled channels function as stretchable circuit wires or capacitor electrodes.
